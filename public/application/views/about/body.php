We are believers in Jesus Christ who have personally received Him as our Lord and Saviour. We love Him and endeavour to give Him the first place in all things. We have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, born again of the Father’s divine life, and filled with the Holy Spirit. We treasure the Holy Bible as God’s revelation of Himself and of His eternal purpose. We hold the common faith which is revealed in the Bible and is common to all genuine believers.
We recognize all born-again Christians are members of the one Body of Christ which should not be divided by race, culture, social status or non-essential items of the faith. We seek to follow the pattern revealed in the New Testament where churches were designated according to the city or locality, e.g. the church in Jerusalem, or Antioch, or Corinth. We meet as believers in Toronto to express this oneness. We have fellowship with other churches to enjoy the fellowship of Christ’s body but are not affiliated with any denomination. 
As an expression of the church in Toronto, we strive to be representative of the multicultural city we live in. Therefore when you are with us it is not uncommon to see local born Canadians sitting beside recent or long-time immigrants. And why not? After all, that is the Toronto we live and work in.

We believe that all God's people can worship and serve Him together. Our Christian community is composed of people from various trades and careers and encompasses a wide range of ages. In our Sunday morning service we are blessed to have children, young people in their teens, college and university students, middle-aged parents, grandparents, and we are delighted to have a few great-grandparents. We truly believe that God bridges every generation gap.

 In our church meetings many people participate. Some might pray or declare some praise to God publicly. Others might stand to tell of how God has moved in their lives recently. But, you should never feel pressured, thinking this is what is expected of all. We are happy to say that we have members who do not pray or praise or testify publicly, and are very vital members of our church community. So come as you are. Enjoy. Sit back and relax, and feel free to proceed at your own pace.
